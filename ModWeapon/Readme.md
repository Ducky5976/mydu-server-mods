# ModWeapon: sample code using new raycast API

This messy mod contains sample code that one might find useful.

It is not useable out of the box as many things are hard-coded, like
avatar and construct ids and recast server Url.

It illustrates in a nutshell:

- Npcs roaming a construct using RecastServer
- Npcs detecting player line-of-sight
- Construct minimap with avatar position display
- Hand weapon dealing damage
- Bouncing a laser shot off walls


Use the source luke! :)
